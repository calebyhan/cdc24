## Project Description

Our project involves analyzing the possible correlation between the number of reviews and polarity of restaurants in London
in comparison to its proximity to a public bus stop or a metro station.

## Data

We used the TourPedia API to retrieve all restaurant data available in London. We then averaged the polarity for each restaurant.

We then found the closest bus stop and metro station to each restaurant using the London Bus Stops and London Metro Stations datasets.

## Analysis

We used a linear regression model to analyze the correlation between the number of reviews and the polarity of the restaurants in relation to their proximity to a bus stop or metro station.
